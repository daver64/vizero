This is a test file to verify the help system works correctly.

We should be able to:
1. Type :help to load manual.md
2. See the manual content in the current buffer
3. See that the buffer is read-only (ro) in the status bar
4. Type :q to return to this original buffer
5. Verify we're back to this content

Let's test it!
